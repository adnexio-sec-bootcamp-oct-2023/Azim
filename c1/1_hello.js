// Hello, World is normally used as an introduction to new programmers

/*
    This is because Hello, World was initially introduced in a C 
    programming textbook as a small test program. Since then, this
    "Hello, World!" printing action has been used a lot of times. 
    Since I previously worked with embedded software, printing Hello
    World has been a good practice to know whether this certain
    program has started or not. It can also be an indicator of a 
    background process is starting when debugging logs.

console.log("Hello, World!");
