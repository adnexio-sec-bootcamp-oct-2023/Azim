/*
Design a Vehicle class with properties like make, model, and year. Implement methods to:
Display vehicle details using a template literal.
A static method that returns the number of vehicle instances created.
Then, extend this Vehicle class with a Car subclass. The Car class should have additional properties 
like mileage and a method to calculate the age of the car based on the current year.
